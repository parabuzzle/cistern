Cistern is a log collection application.

Cistern is a lightweight server that collects log events and displays them in a useful way. The application collects events from many different sources and allows viewing and graphing of that data for admins and developers.

Cistern was born out of need for a place to allow developers to view logs on production machines without a need for the developer to have access to the production environment.
